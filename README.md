# Student-Behaviour-Study


As students for more than three years in university, we've seen a lot â€“ our own 
stories and those of our friends. We've learned about different aspects of 
student life and what influences it. This motivated us and got us thinking about 
helping new students. We wanted to figure out the key to getting good grades 
while still enjoying life outside of studies.
So, we did a study. We looked at various parts of a student's daily life like 
hobbies, money situations, how far they live from the university, and more. 
Then, we compared all this info with their grades, happiness levels, and other 
interesting things. Our goal was to find out what makes students successful..
